# Current Status

Last verified main baseline: `514a8427e8bf16e269126b2dc021d019fbf7fd7f`

## Verified autonomous boundary

Stages E0-E10A are merged. Exact-main CI for E10A passed workflow run #13 (`33151035003`). The engine remains non-authoritative and shadow-first.

Verified capabilities include:

- provider-agnostic correction contracts and explicit abstention states;
- stable score/event identities;
- bounded candidate search;
- meter and onset constraints;
- deterministic candidate resolver requiring independent evidence classes;
- bounded polyphonic voice candidate generation;
- classical-guitar and piano soft-prior profiles;
- explicit `VOICE != STAFF` and `HAND != STAFF` invariants;
- immutable correction projection with stale-before protection;
- reversible projection for currently supported patch fields;
- fail-closed unsupported relation correction;
- pure SesliTab-shaped shadow adapter contract;
- explicit teacher-approved provenance;
- deterministic benchmark reporting correction coverage separately from precision;
- pinned CC0 reference-source identities for one piano and one classical-guitar score;
- reference sources remain non-gold until explicit teacher approval.

E10B adds bounded pending review packets for the selected real-source excerpts. It does not invent or assume teacher approval.

## Safety boundary

Not implemented or authorized:

- production MusicXML overwrite;
- automatic application of correction proposals;
- Audiveris runtime modification;
- provider/network execution from the core;
- inferred relation mutation without a relation model;
- external AI model dependency;
- universal 97-99% OMR accuracy claims.

E11 controlled automatic correction is deliberately NOT STARTED and requires a separate explicit safety authorization after representative teacher-approved benchmark evidence.

E12 visual second-opinion AI is also not started. Any future AI component must be optional evidence only.

## Repository governance

`main` is protected by active repository ruleset `main` (id `21713803`). Pull requests are required, `test-and-build` is a strict required status check, branch deletion and non-fast-forward updates are blocked, and no bypass actor is configured.
